                        <h2>ONLINE WORKOUT TRAINER. </h2>
                        <p>Are you one of those people, who just can’t get themselves up to go to the gym? Don’t worry - many people are like that and it takes time to develop good fitness habits. To give you a little extra motivation, in this two-part article I decided to share with you thirteen reasons to start training today.</p>

        <h4>Best Training</h4>
                        <p>How much can you transform your torso in just four weeks? A lot – so long as you follow this 16-session training plan to the letter. It’s been designed to work your chest and back muscles twice a week – which means your biceps and triceps also get a double whammy of workload – to completely push these major muscle groups outside their comfort zone so your body has no option but to repair the damage by building a bigger, stronger and more defined body. You’ll also hit all your other major muscles, including your legs, to increase your fat-burning potential so you can get bigger and leaner – fast.</p>

        <h4>Stretching Training</h4>
        <p>Stretching may not be the most exciting part of working out,
             but doing flexibility work is just as important for a well-rounded fitness routine as strength and cardio work. Incorporating some
              stretching exercises into your workout schedule will help you improve flexibility, reduce tightness, and ultimately, make your workouts more efficient and safe.
      . As we age, our muscles get shorter and less elastic, she adds.
      "We need to take an active role in maintaining and improving the length of our muscles so we can continue to enjoy our abilities without pain."</p>
